An on hand application MTN users can use for all their Mobile Money transactions. Whether it's sending money to a distant relative, to someone in proximity (use QR Codes) or even making payments to a supported retailer, this financial transaction app would lead to the normalization of Mobile Money transactions. Making it's convience, efficiency and security; the new digital standard form of trading in under developed countries like eSwatini. Modeled using a Monolithic-Microservice Hybrid-based architecture.
